	0.1.3 released.

	* Added support for most of the extended capabilities of the CM-32L/LAPC-I (more rhythm timbres, more rhythm key mappings, more PCM samples).
	* The control ROM is now identified by searching for matching ID strings at various locations in the file. There are now a lot of safety checks to help ensure that a bad ROM will not crash the emulator.
	* Three control ROM versions are now identified and mapped out - an original MT-32 control ROM, an original CM-32L ROM, and the Blue Ridge modified MT-32 ROM.
	* Now supports the expression controller properly.
	* Sustain is now turned off correctly again.
	* "All Notes Off" no longer stops notes held by the sustain controller.
	* Implemented "Reset all controllers".
	* Stereo pan positions are no longer inverted.
	* Volume, pitch, filter and envelopes are now more accurately calculated. Overall, the sound emulation is much more accurate.
	* Waveforms are now generated on the fly. Waveform cache files are no longer necessary and can be deleted.
	* Handling of unusual sysex messages has been improved (fixes sysex messages from Java's MIDI classes on Windows).
	* Fixed a reverb bug during periods of silence.
	* Master tuning is now properly initialised to 0x4A (442Hz).
