Installation:

 1) Ensure that you have oemsetup.inf and mt32emu.dll unpacked to the same
    directory as your MT32_PCM.ROM and MT32_CONTROL.ROM (not provided).
    Remember the location of this directory.
 2) Open Control Panel.
 3) Double-click on "Add New Hardware".
 4) Click "Next" until you come to a message asking you whether you have
    already installed the hardware.
 5) Select the "Yes" option and click "Next".
 6) A list of installed hardware will appear. Scroll to the bottom of the list
    and select the last entry, which should be something like "New Hardware".
    Click "Next".
 7) Select "Choose hardware manually from a list" and click "Next".
 8) Select "Sound, Video and Game Controllers" and click "Next".
 9) Click "Have Disk...".
10) In the window that pops up, click "Browse..." and choose the directory to
    which you unpacked the oemsetup.inf and mt32emu.dll files. Click "OK".
11) If a window pops up complaining about the lack of Windows Logo testing,
    click "Install Anyway" or similar.
12) "MT-32 Synth Emulator" should have appeared selected in a list.
    Click "Next" twice.
13) The driver *still* isn't Windows Logo tested, so click "Install Anyway" if
    necessary.
14) The driver should now have been installed; click "Finish".
15) A dialog box will recommend that you reboot. Go ahead if you enjoy that
    sort of thing, but it shouldn't be necessary for a fresh installation.
